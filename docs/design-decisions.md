### Design Decisions

- **Digital Twin Approach:**  
  We model a city (Los Angeles) as a digital twin where each agent has a realistic profile and daily routine generated via chain‑of‑thought reasoning.

- **Human-Agent Modeling:**  
  Agents are created with demographics such as age, occupation, and income. Their daily routines are generated by prompting a large language model (e.g., Mistral) to simulate realistic behavior.

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  The project is split into a frontend (Next.js), backend (FastAPI), and ML module (custom Gym environment with RL training). This allows independent development and scaling.

- **Containerization:**  
  Docker and Kubernetes are used for consistent environments and production deployment.

- **Reinforcement Learning:**  
  RL is incorporated as a decision-making tool (e.g., when to trigger lockdown policies) and uses Stable Baselines3.
